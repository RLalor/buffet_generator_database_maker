This program is part of a bigger program. 
It's sole purpose is to provide a quick convenient way to populate categorised dictionaries with themed dishes for use in my buffet generator program. It uses os, json, pprint and system modules. If it has themes_data.json in the directory it will provide an option to open that data or save it. If the .json is not in the directory it will be created.
