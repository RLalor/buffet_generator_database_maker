This program is part of a bigger program. 
It's sole purpose is to provide a quick convenient way to populate categorised dictionaries with themed dishes for use in my buffet generator program here: https://github.com/RLalor/buffet_generator. 
It uses os, json, pprint and system modules. 
If it has themes_data.json in the directory it will provide an option to open that data or save it. 
If the .json is not in the directory it will be created.

If themes are lacking variety the generated menu will lack variety.
The following themes need more dishes:

carib only has chicken

indian only has chicken and lamb

middle eastern only has chicken and lamb

scandi only has veal and 1 carb and a couple veg

spanish only has 1 chicken

indonesian only has beef and chicken
